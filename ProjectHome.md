The goal of this project was to create an easy to install app with a simple interface for users.  It would allow reporting for upper management and a way for operations to run scans without direct access to Nessus.

8/14/06 - I just opened this project on Google.  As soon as I'm done testing the code for version 1.2, I will post it on the home page (link on right).  As soon as Google hosts tarballs for projects, I will host the files here.

8/19/07 - Version 2.0 is complete.  http://simpleness.stlsawall.com
